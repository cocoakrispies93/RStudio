% Lab 3
% Using the example distance chart these are several calculations 
% that can be solved based on the chart,  e.g. finding the 
% total distance of a person who travelled on a trip with n 
% stops; finding the total cost of all trips in the last month 

% My calculations are minimum and maximum distance based on a 3-row sample
% Converting the 3 row sample into miles from km
% Determining from the sample which flights are below 100 km, not counting
% zero values, with a hypothetical constraint of 100 miles being the max
% distance, for cost or time.

% Use matrix. (20â€™)
% Has a user-defined functions at the bottom, under100() and toMiles()
